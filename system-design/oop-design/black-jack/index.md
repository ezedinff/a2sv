# Black Jack

## Problem
Every player has 1000 casino tokens to start.
The dealer has 10000 casino tokens to start.
if the player wins, that one get double of the bet.
if the dealer wins, dealer will take the token from the player.
if the points are the same, then the dealer wins.
A could be 1 or 11.

Example:
```
Player(10)
Player(100)
Player(500)
Card([1, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 9, 10])
InitialCards()
compareResult()
```
