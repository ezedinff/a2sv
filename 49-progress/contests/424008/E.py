You are given an array of 𝑛
 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
.

You have to create an array of 𝑛
 integers 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑛
 such that:

The array 𝑏
 is a rearrangement of the array 𝑎
, that is, it contains the same values and each value appears the same number of times in the two arrays. In other words, the multisets {𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛}
 and {𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑛}
 are equal.
For example, if 𝑎=[1,−1,0,1]
, then 𝑏=[−1,1,1,0]
 and 𝑏=[0,1,−1,1]
 are rearrangements of 𝑎
, but 𝑏=[1,−1,−1,0]
 and 𝑏=[1,0,2,−3]
 are not rearrangements of 𝑎
.

For all 𝑘=1,2,…,𝑛
 the sum of the first 𝑘
 elements of 𝑏
 is nonzero. Formally, for all 𝑘=1,2,…,𝑛
, it must hold
𝑏1+𝑏2+⋯+𝑏𝑘≠0.
If an array 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑛
 with the required properties does not exist, you have to print NO.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤1000
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each testcase contains one integer 𝑛
 (1≤𝑛≤50
)  — the length of the array 𝑎
.

The second line of each testcase contains 𝑛
 integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎𝑛
 (−50≤𝑎𝑖≤50
)  — the elements of 𝑎
.

Output
For each testcase, if there is not an array 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑛
 with the required properties, print a single line with the word NO.

Otherwise print a line with the word YES, followed by a line with the 𝑛
 integers 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑛
.

If there is more than one array 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏𝑛
 satisfying the required properties, you can print any of them.

Note
Explanation of the first testcase: An array with the desired properties is 𝑏=[1,−2,3,−4]
. For this array, it holds:

The first element of 𝑏
 is 1
.
The sum of the first two elements of 𝑏
 is −1
.
The sum of the first three elements of 𝑏
 is 2
.
The sum of the first four elements of 𝑏
 is −2
.
Explanation of the second testcase: Since all values in 𝑎
 are 0
, any rearrangement 𝑏
 of 𝑎
 will have all elements equal to 0
 and therefore it clearly cannot satisfy the second property described in the statement (for example because 𝑏1=0
). Hence in this case the answer is NO.

Explanation of the third testcase: An array with the desired properties is 𝑏=[1,1,−1,1,−1]
. For this array, it holds:

The first element of 𝑏
 is 1
.
The sum of the first two elements of 𝑏
 is 2
.
The sum of the first three elements of 𝑏
 is 1
.
The sum of the first four elements of 𝑏
 is 2
.
The sum of the first five elements of 𝑏
 is 1
.
Explanation of the fourth testcase: An array with the desired properties is 𝑏=[−40,13,40,0,−9,−31]
. For this array, it holds:

The first element of 𝑏
 is −40
.
The sum of the first two elements of 𝑏
 is −27
.
The sum of the first three elements of 𝑏
 is 13
.
The sum of the first four elements of 𝑏
 is 13
.
The sum of the first five elements of 𝑏
 is 4
.
The sum of the first six elements of 𝑏
 is −27
.

'''
The prompt describes multiple test cases, each with an array of integers,
where each test case requires the creation of another array of integers
that contains the same values and each value appears the same number of times.
The new array must satisfy the condition that the sum of the first k elements must
not be zero for all values of k. If such an array can't be created, the output must
be "NO". If such an array can be created, the output must be "YES" followed by the new array.
