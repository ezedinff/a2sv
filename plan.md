# Books
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)
This is the simplest book to get anyone started in studying for coding interviews.

If you’re an absolute beginner, I recommend you to start here. The questions have very details explanations that are easy to understand with basic knowledge of algorithms and data structures.
- [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1849967202)
- [Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)
- [Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Made-Easy/dp/819324527X)
- [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael/dp/1118290275)
- [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python](https://www.amazon.com/Problem-Solving-Algorithms-Structures-2nd/dp/1590282571)

[Elements of Programming Interviews](https://amzn.to/3PYcKEq)
If you’re a little more experienced, every question in this book is at the interviewing level of all large technology companies.

If you’ve mastered the questions in this book, then you are more than ready for the average technology interview. The book is not as beginner friendly as CTCI but it does include a study plan depending on how much you need to prepare for your interviews. This is my personal favorite book I carried everywhere in university.
- [NeetCode blind 75 — YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLlXCFG5TnA&list=PLot-Xpze53ldVwtstag2TL4HQhAnC8ATf&ab_channel=NeetCode)
Blind has a list of 75 questions that is generally enough to solve most coding interviews. It’s a very curated and focused list for the most essential algorithms to leverage your time.

The playlist above is one of the clearest explanations I’ve ever seen and highly recommend if you need an explanation on any of the problems.
- [CSES Problem Set — Tasks](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
These problems are hard. Really hard for anyone who hasn’t practiced algorithms and is not beginner friendly. But if you are able to complete the sorting and searching section, you will be more capable than the average LeetCode user and be more than ready for your coding interview.

Consider this if you’re comfortable with LeetCode medium questions and find the questions in CTCI too easy.
- [Introduction to Algorithms]()
This is the most common and best textbook anyone could use to learn algorithms. It’s also the textbook my university used personally to learn the core and essential algorithms to most coding problems.

The 4th edition was recently released and is still relevant to MIT students. If you need structure and a traditional classroom setting to study, follow MIT’s algorithm course here.
- [William Fiset — Graph Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgXR2OWQnLc&list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P&ab_channel=WilliamFiset)
Graph theory does come up in interviews (and was a question I had at both Bloomberg and Google). Stay prepared and follow William Fiset’s graph theory explanation.

The diagrams are comprehensive and the step-by-step explanations are the best I’ve ever seen on the topic.
- [CSES.fi Handbook](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)
This handbook is for people who are strongly proficient with most Leetcode algorithms. It’s a free resource that strongly complements the CSES.fi curriculum.
